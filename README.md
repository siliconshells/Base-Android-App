# Base Android App
A base Android App able to connect to a REST backend using Retrofit from Square. It's able to move between two pages (Activities)
Done on Android Studio updated to the latest version as of 22-04-19 and uses Androidx.

Remember to go to Preferences(for Mac and maybe Properties for Windows) -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Instant Run and disable it. It'll save you hours or days of unexplained Run errors. It can check itself back after an update.
